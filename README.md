# Greeting!
Nice to meet you, my name is Luong Hoang Anh. I am currently an undergraduate student at FPT University, where I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence with a concentration in Data Science. I have taken courses in big data, machine learning, and deep learning. I have also gained experience working with data through my participation in several research projects at the university.

I have always been fascinated by artificial intelligence (AI). I remember being a child and watching science fiction movies about robots and computers that could think for themselves. I was amazed by the possibilities that AI offered, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of this field.

As I got older, I learned more about AI and how it is used in the real world. I was particularly interested in the use of AI in data science. I saw how data could be used to train AI models to make predictions, solve problems, and automate tasks. I was really really excited by the potential of AI to revolutionize the way we live and work!

But then, I decided to pursue a career in data engineering because I wanted to be at the forefront of this field. I wanted to use my skills to help businesses and organizations harness the power of data. I also wanted to be a part of the team that develops new AI technologies that can make a positive impact on the world! Seem like a big dream, huh?

In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects that involve data science and AI. I have built some machine learning models, and I have also created several data visualization tools. I am always looking for new ways to use data to solve problems and make a difference in the world.

With my passion for AI technologies, I am committed to using my skills to make a positive impact on the world. I am confident that I have the skills and experience to be a successful data engineer intern, and I am eager to contribute to the field of AI!

This is the end, have a good day!
