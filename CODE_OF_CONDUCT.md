A code of conduct file is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your project's participants. It is a way to create a positive social atmosphere for your community and to protect not just your participants, but yourself.

A code of conduct file should include the following:

A statement of purpose. What is the goal of your code of conduct? What do you hope to achieve by having one?
A definition of acceptable behavior. What behaviors are considered acceptable in your community?
A definition of unacceptable behavior. What behaviors are not acceptable in your community?
A process for reporting violations. How can participants report violations of the code of conduct?
A process for addressing violations. How will violations of the code of conduct be addressed?
